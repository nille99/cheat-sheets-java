## Useful git flows
**_Flow 1 - Cloning a project from your GitHub to your local repository, making changes and pushing it to GitHub._**

```
cd workspace  (Navigate to your workspace!)
git clone #LINK TO YOUR REPOSITORY#
git status
gedit test.txt
(add: ”I just added this line to this file” within your test.txt and save it.
git status.
git add -u
git commit -m "This my latest commit“
git push

```
